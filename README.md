# BirdWatch Project ü¶ú

A simple Eclipse plugin based application for tracking and managing bird sightings.

## Getting Started üöÄ

You can start by either cloning the Git Repo or by heading to the [Latest Release](https://github.com/MurLocBlue/BirdWatch-Project/releases) page.

### Backend üîß

#### Using Bash (Recommended)
1. Open a Bash Terminal in the root of the project
2. Make the start script executable: `chmod +x run_tests.sh`
3. Run the start script: `./start.sh`

To stop the application: `./stop.sh`

#### Manual Docker Commands
Alternatively, you can run the Docker commands manually:
1. Open a Terminal in the root of the project and run `docker-compose build`
2. Once the project is built, run `docker-compose up -d` to start the Posgres Database and Spring API Service

To stop and remove all of the containers, simply run `docker-compose down`

### Frontend üíª

1. Import the `plugin` and `plugin_api` projects into Eclipse
2. Configure your run configurations to start `birdwatch_plugin` as a `workbench` type application
3. Run the plugin

To stop the UI plugin, simply close the window

### Running Tests üß™

#### Using the Test Script (Recommended)
1. Open a Bash Terminal in the root of the project
2. Make the test script executable: `chmod +x run_tests.sh`
3. Run the tests: `./run_tests.sh`

The script will:
- Check if Docker is running
- Ensure the PostgreSQL database container is up
- Wait for the database to be ready
- Run all tests using Maven

#### Manual Test Execution
Alternatively, you can run the tests manually:
1. Ensure Docker is running
2. Start the containers: `docker-compose up -d`
3. Wait for the database to be ready
4. Navigate to the api directory: `cd api`
5. Run the tests: `mvn test`
